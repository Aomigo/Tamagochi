A project i've been thinking of lately that i finally decided to start.
It is pretty straightforward :
- A Tamagotchi kind of combined with a 2d adventure game,
- You can travel, do dungeons, eat and make your character exercise.

This game is far from finished, here are the things i want to add :
- A loot system (Done),
- Easter eggs (WIP),
- More interactions with the character,
- And finally, add multiple character.
